# Purpose
AXRAIL Assessment

# Note
Please have a look at my solution, I welcome and appreciate any feedback!

# Task
You are tasked to code the vending machine logic out using Python Programming Language. In your code, you can have a few drinks as your items with any price (no coin). The customer should be able to insert any notes to buy his preferred drinks. The outcome is to release the least amount of notes back to the customer.

# Train of thought on the assessment
- Initially I wanted to just write a single page simpler program, but wanted to showcase a bit more on what I could offer
- It may seem like a lot of files/code for such a simple program, but it was written with the intention of future improvements/feature addition, thus included some boilerplate that may be beneficial

# How to execute this code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal and change directory intto the cloned repositry
3. Run the program with the command below:
    `python3 main.py`

# What to expect:
![normal operation](/assets/vending_machine_operation.PNG)

![shutdown](/assets/vending_machine_shutdown.PNG)

# What I could've done better
1. Apply Test Driven Development - write unit tests along the way
2. A series of small commits, instead of 1 large commit
3. Added CICD pipeline with Github Actions to run tests for the program
